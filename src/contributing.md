# How can I contribute? Here are some ideas

- Use it! Indeed there is quite some work left for custom dependency providers.
  So just using the crate, building you own dependency provider for your
  favorite programming language and letting us know how it turned out would be
  amazing feedback already!

- Non failing extension for multiple versions. Currently, the solver works by
  allowing only one version per package. In some contexts however, we may want
  to not fail if multiple versions are required, and return instead multiple
  versions per package. Such situations may be for example allowing multiple
  major versions of the same crate. But it could be more general than that exact
  scenario.
