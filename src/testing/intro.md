# Testing and benchmarking

Any non-trivial software is flawed and it is a programmer's goal to make it
correct, readable and fast. Testing helps getting correct programs, and
benchmarking helps making them faster. In this section we present the approach
and tools used to test and benchmark pubgrub.

**Note on reproducibility:**

"Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, but expecting different
results". Einstein [probably didn't came up with that one][einstein-quote] but
this is still very much the definition of non-reproducibility, and it can drive
us mad when chasing [heisenbugs][heisenbug]. For this reason we try to avoid
everything that would make pubgrub non reproducible, such that every failed test
can be reproduced and fixed.
