# Benchmarking

Performance optimization is a tedious but very rewarding practice if done right.
It requires rigor and sometime arcane knowledge of lol level details. If you are
interested in performance optimization for pubgrub, we suggest reading first
[The Rust Performance Book][perf-book]

## Side note about code layout and performance

Changing your username has an impact on the performances of your code. This is
not clickbait I promess, but simply an effect of layout changes. Se before
making any assumption on performance improvement or regression try making sure
that measures are actually reflecting the intent of the code changes and not
something else. It was shown that code layout changes can produce Â±40% in
performance changes.

I highly recommend watching the talk ["Performance Matters" by Emery
Berger][perf-talk] presented at strangeloop 2019 for more information on "sound
performance analysis" and "effective performance profiling". There is an [issue
in criterion][criterion-stabilizer] about the "stabilizer" tool. And for causal
profiling, it seems possible to directly use [coz][coz] for rust programs.
